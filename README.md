## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Online Dice Generator project. This project aims to create a user-friendly web application that generates random dice rolls for various gaming purposes. The project follows Agile methodologies to ensure iterative development, constant feedback, and timely delivery of the product.

## 2. Agile Methodology

Agile methodologies are used to develop software in an iterative and incremental manner. The core values of Agile that were imbibed in this project are:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**: We prioritize effective communication and collaboration among team members to enhance understanding and cooperation.

- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**: While documentation is important, the primary focus is on delivering a functional product. Documentation is kept concise and meaningful.

- **Responding to change over following a plan**: We remain flexible and open to changes in requirements, making it easier to adapt to new ideas and improvements.

## 3. Project Overview

The Online Dice Generator is a web-based application that allows users to simulate the roll of dice commonly used in various tabletop and role-playing games. The application consists of three main components: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## 4. Team Collaboration

The team consists of three members, each responsible for a specific part of the project: HTML (Anurag Negi), CSS (Bhavya Jain), and JavaScript (Rohit Hooda). Regular communication was maintained through various channels such as team meetings, chat platforms, and version control systems.

## 5. Features

The key features of the Online Dice Generator include:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

- **Roll Button**: A "Roll" button generates a random number based on the selected dice.

- **Result Display**: The generated number is displayed on the screen, simulating the roll of the selected dice.

- **Roll History**: The history of three previous numbers obtained from rolling the dice is also displayed.

## 6. User Stories
1. As a player, I want to see the history of the random numbers generated.
2. As a player, I want to click a button to roll the selected dice and see the result.
3. As a player, I want the interface to be visually appealing and responsive.

## 7. Sprint Planning

The project was divided into two sprints. Each sprint involved planning, implementation, testing, and documentation.

Sprint 1:
- HTML (Anurag Negi): Create the basic structure of the web page.
- CSS (Bhavya Jain): Implement styling for the dice and roll button.
- JavaScript (Rohit Hooda): Set up the dice rolling logic.

Sprint 2:
- HTML (Anurag Negi): Implement responsive design for various devices.
- CSS (Bhavya Jain): Refine the styling for a polished look.
- JavaScript (Rohit Hooda): Add animations for dice rolling and result display.

## 8. Daily Standups

Daily standup meetings were conducted to ensure transparency and collaboration among team members. Each member shared their progress, discussed challenges, and clarified doubts. This helped in identifying and addressing issues promptly.

## 9. Sprint Review and Retrospective

At the end of each sprint, a review and retrospective were held:

Sprint Review:
- The team demonstrated the completed features.

Retrospective:
- The team discussed what went well and what could be improved.
- Adjustments were made to the development process based on the retrospective feedback.

## 10. Conclusion

The Online Dice Generator project successfully embraced Agile methodologies, focusing on collaboration, flexibility, and delivering value to the end-users. The iterative development approach allowed for continuous improvement and incorporation of user feedback. By adhering to Agile values, the team created a functional and user-friendly web application that meets the needs of tabletop gamers and role-playing enthusiasts.
